# Celerity

This is a project I built when I was participating in Angelhack Taipei 2018. My team and I were building an online security system
that can allow people around to report problems about anything. We have two groups of clients: people who report about the incidents
and the institutions or agencies that help to resolve those problems. We built a mobile app for people to report through 
pictures and descriptions, and a website for the institutions to retrieve those reports.

This repo contains the code for the website that can receive requests sent from the mobile app. It displays the requests realtime 
and displays the reports in a pretty list format.
